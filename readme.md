# Till it Breaks

Till it Breaks is a HUD mod for Minecraft using Fabric Loader.

This mod displays the durability that is left of items on the items itself. By using this mod you'll always know when your tool is about to break.

A nice little feature is also the functionality of displaying your current arrow amount on the bow and crossbow item.
